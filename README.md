As an avid gamer, I usually spend my free time playing games. During this winter break, I did not have much to do, and with the lovely New England weather outside, I decided to spend as much time playing games as possible. Only when I looked back did I realized how much time I actually spent being unproductive. 

This extension is a result of that - a constant reminder of how much time I spent playing games and doing nothing. I hope this helps other people as well. 

Enjoy!
